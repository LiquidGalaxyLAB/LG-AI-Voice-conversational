### Google Cloud AI Speech-to-Text with Gemini

Google provides a speech-to-text model API providing up to 60 minutes of transcribing audio per month using the Google Gemini model. The advanced speech AI utilizes Chirp, Google Cloud's foundation model for speech trained on a massive amount of data. With up to 60 minutes of free transcribing of audio per month, allowing users to have minimal barriers when using the API.

## Text-to-speech


### Google Cloud AI with WaveNet TTS

The Google Cloud AI's text-to-speech API allows users to input text and get back an audio file in response, providing natural-sounding audio which can be customizable with options such as language, gender, and accent for all users to use the app. WaveNet was one of the first text-to-speech models that sounded natural-sounding speech, starting at Google Deepmind. The WaveNet model usage is free of charge for every 1 million characters per month.
